# Systems Engineering Notes  
*A Structured Self-Training Program in Systems Thinking*

This site documents a progressive study journey through practical systems engineering concepts, using a single use, fixed wing expendable UAV platform.

The objective is not deep specialization in individual subsystems, but understanding how subsystems connect, interact, and integrate into a coherent system.

The study progresses from:

- System overview and mission context  
- Subsystem fundamentals (airframe, propulsion, avionics, power, communication)  
- Architecture thinking  
- Requirement structuring (SRS)  
- Interface definition (IDS)  
- Documentation coherence and integration logic  

These notes are written to clarify systems thinking through structured progression.
