Launch Phase","text":"<p>Launch is the moment when the UAV transitions from a static object to a flying aircraft.</p> <p>Launch is the most stressful part of the mission because:</p> <ul> <li>High acceleration occurs  </li> <li>Airflow becomes chaotic  </li> <li>Aerodynamic forces build rapidly  </li> <li>Control surfaces may initially be ineffective  </li> <li>IMU experiences shock loading  </li> <li>GNSS signal may temporarily degrade  </li> <li>Autopilot must switch flight modes at the correct moment  </li> <li>Thrust becomes required immediately  </li> </ul> <p>For expendable UAVs, common launch methods include:</p> <ul> <li>Catapult launch  </li> <li>Rocket-assisted launch  </li> <li>Runway takeoff  </li> <li>Vertical launch  </li> </ul> <p>Catapult Launch</p> <p>Catapult launch systems can be elastic (rubber band sling), pneumatic (air pressure piston), or rail launcher with bungee assist. The UAV typically accelerates between 5\u201315 g (sometimes up to 20 g), and this acceleration phase lasts approximately 0.3\u20131.0 seconds. The flight controller operates in a dedicated \u201claunch mode,\u201d in which control surfaces may be fixed, the autopilot temporarily limits active corrections, and sensors anticipate shock loading. The UAV detects launch through acceleration above a threshold, rising airspeed, and rail switch logic. The motor or engine provides full power, the IMU experiences high shock, and the UAV leaves the rail.</p> <p>Rocket-Assisted Launch (RAL)</p> <p>Rocket-Assisted Launch is used for heavier expendable drones where the electric motor is not sufficient, the catapult length is too short, or an immediate steep climb is required. The UAV is placed on a rail, the booster ignites, strong initial thrust is generated, the UAV accelerates rapidly, the booster burns out and separates, and the main propulsion system takes over.</p> <p>Vertical Launch</p> <p>In a vertical launch configuration, the UAV lifts off vertically using dedicated lift motors or a combined propulsion system capable of generating upward thrust. The vehicle climbs straight up until it reaches a safe altitude, then transitions into forward flight. The most critical challenge in vertical launch is the transition phase, when the aircraft shifts from vertical lift to aerodynamic flight. During this transition, control logic must reconfigure smoothly while aerodynamic surfaces gradually become effective.</p> <p>Runway Takeoff</p> <p>In runway takeoff, the UAV accelerates along a prepared surface until sufficient airspeed is reached for lift-off. Acceleration is gradual and controlled, and aerodynamic surfaces become effective progressively as airspeed increases. Because there is no sudden shock or extreme acceleration, IMU measurements remain stable and navigation filters operate under normal conditions. The key requirement is sufficient runway length and reliable propulsion performance.</p>"},{"location":"ch01-uav-system-overview/#7-autonomous-flight-phase","title":"7.
